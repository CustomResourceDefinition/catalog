Note the response body can be very large.\n    For example the a command like `oc get -A pods` generates a response body containing the YAML description of every pod in the cluster.\n\n# Extensions\n\nThe following features are extensions to the standard [Kube Audit Policy]\n\n## Wildcards\n\nNames of users, groups, namespaces, and resources can have a leading or trailing '*' character.\nFor example namespace 'openshift-*' matches 'openshift-apiserver' or 'openshift-authentication.\nResource '*/status' matches 'Pod/status' or 'Deployment/status'\n\nEvents which include both a 'resource' and 'subresource' are evaluated by combing those\nfields with a forward slash.  This means rules that rely upon a resource type that may or\nmay not include the subresource should be adjusted to cover all the required use-cases (i.e. ['pod','pod/*']).\n\n## Default Rules\n\nEvents that do not match any rule in the policy are filtered as follows:\n- User events (ie. non-system and non-serviceaccount) are forwarded\n- Read-only system events (get/list/watch etc) are dropped\n- Service account write events that occur within the same namespace as the service account are dropped\n- All other events are forwarded, subject to any configured [rate limits][#rate-lmiting]\n\nIf you want to disable these defaults, end your rules list with rule that has only a `level` field.\nAn empty rule matches any event, and prevents the defaults from taking effect.\n\n## Omit Response Codes\n\nYou can drop events based on the HTTP status code in the response. See the OmitResponseCodes field.\n\n[Kube Audit Policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/apiserver-audit.v1/#audit-k8s-io-v1-Policy\n[Kubernetes Auditing]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/",
