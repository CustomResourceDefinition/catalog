The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the\nPreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the\ncontainer will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace\nperiod (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes\nor until the termination grace period is reached.\nMore info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks",
