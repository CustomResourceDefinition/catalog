This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.\n\nObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template` and `MachineSet.Template`,\nwhich are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases\nand read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies\nthe API and some issues that can impact user experience.\n\nDuring the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)\nfor v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs,\nspecifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: \"null\"`.\nThe investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version\nwhen handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.\n\nIn more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta`\nhad validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).\nThe `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null`\nwhich breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.\n\nIn future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded\ntypes. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.",
