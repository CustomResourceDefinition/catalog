The image pull specification\nprovided to the pod will be compared to the source locations described in imageTagMirrors\nand the image may be pulled down from any of the mirrors in the list instead of the\nspecified repository allowing administrators to choose a potentially faster mirror.\nTo use mirrors to pull images using digest specification only, users should configure\na list of mirrors using \"ImageDigestMirrorSet\" CRD.\n\nIf the image pull specification matches the repository of \"source\" in multiple imagetagmirrorset objects,\nonly the objects which define the most specific namespace match will be used.\nFor example, if there are objects using quay.io/libpod and quay.io/libpod/busybox as\nthe \"source\", only the objects using quay.io/libpod/busybox are going to apply\nfor pull specification quay.io/libpod/busybox.\nEach “source” repository is treated independently; configurations for different “source”\nrepositories don’t interact.\n\nIf the \"mirrors\" is not specified, the image will continue to be pulled from the specified\nrepository in the pull spec.\n\nWhen multiple policies are defined for the same “source” repository, the sets of defined\nmirrors will be merged together, preserving the relative order of the mirrors, if possible.\nFor example, if policy A has mirrors `a, b, c` and policy B has mirrors `c, d, e`, the\nmirrors will be used in the order `a, b, c, d, e`.  If the orders of mirror entries conflict\n(e.g. `a, b` vs. `b, a`) the configuration is not rejected but the resulting order is unspecified.\nUsers who want to use a deterministic order of mirrors, should configure them into one list of mirrors using the expected order.",
