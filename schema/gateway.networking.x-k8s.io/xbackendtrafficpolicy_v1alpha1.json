Once the budget\nis exceeded, additional retries will be rejected.\n\nFor example, if the retry budget interval is 10 seconds, there have been\n1000 active requests in the past 10 seconds, and the allowed percentage\nof requests that can be retried is 20% (the default), then 200 of those\nrequests may be composed of retries. Active requests will only be\nconsidered for the duration of the interval when calculating the retry\nbudget.

While the HTTPRouteRule Retry stanza can specify whether a\nrequest will be retried, and the number of retry attempts each client\nmay perform, RetryConstraint helps prevent cascading failures such as\nretry storms during periods of consistent failures.\n\nAfter the retry budget has been exceeded, additional retries to the\nbackend MUST return a 503 response to the client.\n\nAdditional configurations for defining a constraint on retries MAY be\ndefined in the future.\n\nSupport: Extended",
