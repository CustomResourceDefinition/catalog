                      - extension scope: `parent_id` should be the ID of the resource you're adding the extension to.
                      - subscription scope: `parent_id` should be like \x60/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\x60
                      - tenant scope: `parent_id` should be /

                      For child level resources, the `parent_id` should be the ID of its parent resource, for example, subnet resource's `parent_id` is the ID of the vnet.

                      For type `Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups`, the `parent_id` could be omitted, it defaults to subscription ID specified in provider or the default subscription (You could check the default subscription by azure cli command: `az account show`).

                      - **List**: A list of paths that need to be exported from the response body. Setting it to `["*"]` will export the full response body. Here's an example. If it sets to `["properties.loginServer", "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"]`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

                      }
                      ```

                      - **Map**: A map where the key is the name for the result and the value is a JMESPath query string to filter the response. Here's an example. If it sets to `{"login_server": "properties.loginServer", "quarantine_status": "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"}`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

                      ```text

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It will be honored

                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception
                  of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The fields that are
                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                      For child level resources, the `parent_id` should be the ID of its parent resource, for example, subnet resource's `parent_id` is the ID of the vnet.

                      For type `Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups`, the `parent_id` could be omitted, it defaults to subscription ID specified in provider or the default subscription (You could check the default subscription by azure cli command: `az account show`).

                      - **Map**: A map where the key is the name for the result and the value is a JMESPath query string to filter the response. Here's an example. If it sets to `{"login_server": "properties.loginServer", "quarantine_status": "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"}`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.
