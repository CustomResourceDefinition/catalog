              RestateDeployment is similar to a Kubernetes Deployment but tailored for Restate services.
              It maintains ReplicaSets and Services for each version to support Restate's versioning requirements,
              ensuring old versions remain available until all invocations against them are complete.

                      Deployment tag - determines Restate deployment identity.

                      A Restate deployment is a specific, versioned instance of your service code.
                      Each deployment is immutable: once registered with Restate, its endpoint and
                      identity (deployment ID) must not change.

                      The tag acts as a stable label that groups multiple Knative Revisions under
                      a single Restate deployment:
                      - **Same tag**: In-place updates create new Knative Revisions within the same
                        Restate deployment (no new registration)
                      - **Changed tag**: Creates a new Restate deployment with a new deployment ID
                        (versioned update)
                      - **No tag specified**: Uses template hash as tag, causing every template change
                        to create a new Restate deployment

                      The tag must be a valid DNS-1035 label: a lowercase RFC 1123 label that consists of
                      lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric
                      character (e.g. 'my-name',  or '123-abc', regex used for validation is
                      '[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?').

                      Example: tag "v1-0" → Configuration "my-service-v1-0" → Restate deployment "dp_abc123"
                               Multiple Knative Revisions (00001, 00002, ...) all serve this deployment.
