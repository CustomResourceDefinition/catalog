          a Datadog Logs Pipeline API https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/logs-pipelines/
          resource, which is used to create and manage Datadog logs custom pipelines.
          Each datadog_logs_custom_pipeline resource defines a complete pipeline.
          The order of the pipelines is maintained in a different resource: datadog_logs_pipeline_order.
          When creating a new pipeline, you need to explicitly add this pipeline to
          the datadog_logs_pipeline_order resource to track the pipeline. Similarly,
          when a pipeline needs to be destroyed, remove its references from the datadog_logs_pipeline_order
          resource.'
