Usage:

  make <target>

Available targets:

  build         Builds the runner container and the catalog tool
  clean         Removes temporarily generated files and builds and removes local container images
  comparison    Updates COMPARISON.md based on the /schema contents
  help          Displays this help
  shell         Opens a shell to a runner container
  tags          Synchronize semantic version tags from kubernetes into this repository
  test          Runs the entire test suite
  update        Updates the /schema contents

Note that all targets with an `_` prefix is meant to be run inside a runner container.

  _check        Runs update using the `test/configuration.yaml` file and outputting to `build/ephemeral/schema` - this is meant as a tool to test a new configuration item locally before adding it
  _schema-check Verifies all schema files against jsonschema schema file - this takes a very long time
