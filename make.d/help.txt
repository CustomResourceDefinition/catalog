Usage:

  make <target>

Available targets:

  build       Builds the runner container and the catalog tool
  clean       Removes temporarily generated files and builds and removes local container images
  comparison  Updates COMPARISON.md based on the /schema contents
  help        Displays this help
  shell       Opens a shell to a runner container
  test        Runs the entire test suite
  update      Updates the /schema contents

Note that all targets with an `_` prefix is meant to be run inside a runner container.

  _check      Runs update using the `test/configuration.yaml` file and outputting to `build/ephemeral/schema` - this is meant as a tool to test a new configuration item locally before adding it
